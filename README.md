When watching a TV show or movie, I often spot a familiar face but can't
remember the actor's name or what other shows I've seen them in.

So I'd go to the IMDb website; find the show; click on "See full cast &
crew"; find the character; click on the actor's name; then scroll through their
"Filmography" to see if I recognize any other shows I've watched. That is both
time-consuming and difficult. Even more so if I want to know if two shows have
actors in common.

So I wrote a program to answer such questions simply and quickly. Now I have
even more fun learning about actors and shows. You might enjoy that as well.

With it you can run simple queries to instantly answer questions about your
favorites such as:

* Who stars in "The Crown"?
* What actresses have played Queen Elisabeth II and Princess Diana?
* What other shows I've seen were they in?
* Did anyone play in both "The Crown" and "The Durrells in Corfu"

To see what it's like before installing, check out my [query
demo screencast](https://youtu.be/91h3mnvV7Ug). It only takes 45 seconds.

The program also creates comprehensive lists and spreadsheets of shows, actors,
and the characters they portray. They're useful as an overview or for discovering
actors and shows you may want to know more about.

The data is extracted from downloaded IMDb .gz files. See
[https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/]() for details of the data those files contain.
