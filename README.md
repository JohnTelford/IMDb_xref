When watching a TV show or movie, have you ever spotted a familiar face but
can't remember the actor's name or what other shows you've seen them in?

To solve this I used to go to the IMDb website; find the show; click on "See full
cast & crew"; find the character; click on the actor's name; then scroll through
their "Filmography" to see if I recognized any other shows I'd watched. This was both
time-consuming and difficult -- even more so if I wanted to know if two shows had
actors in common.

I wrote IMDb_xref to answer such questions simply and quickly. Now I have even more
fun learning about actors and shows.

You can run simple queries to instantly answer questions about your favorites, such
as these I came up with after watching the PBS show "The Crown".

* Who stars in "The Crown"?
* What actresses have played Queen Elisabeth II and Princess Diana?
* What other shows I've seen were they in?
* Did anyone play in both "The Crown" and "The Durrells in Corfu"?

Below is an answer to one question. To see some others, click on it for a short video.

IMDb_xref also creates comprehensive lists and spreadsheets of shows, actors,
and the characters they portray. They're useful as an overview or for discovering
actors and shows you may want to know more about.

The data used is extracted from downloaded IMDb .gz files. See
[https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/]() for details of the data in those files.
