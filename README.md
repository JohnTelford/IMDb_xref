## Motivation

When watching a TV show or movie, have you ever spotted a familiar face but
can't remember the actor's name or what other shows you've seen them in?

To solve this I used to go to the IMDb website; find the show; click on "See full
cast & crew"; find the character; click on the actor's name; then scroll through
their "Filmography" to see if I recognized any other shows I'd watched. This was both
time-consuming and difficult -- even more so if I wanted to know if two shows had
actors in common.

I wrote **IMDb_xref** to answer such questions simply and quickly. Now I have even more
fun learning about actors and shows.

You can run simple queries to instantly answer questions about your favorites, such
as these I came up with after watching the PBS show "The Crown".

* Who stars in "The Crown"?
* What actresses have played Queen Elisabeth II and Princess Diana?
* What other shows I've seen were they in?
* Did anyone play in both "The Crown" and "The Durrells in Corfu"?

Click on the query screenshot below to see a short demo video.

**IMDb_xref** also creates comprehensive lists and spreadsheets of shows, actors,
and the characters they portray. They're useful as an overview or for discovering
actors and shows you may want to know more about.

The data used is extracted from downloaded IMDb .gz files. See
[https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) for details of the data in those files.

## Installation

### Compatibility

Tested on macOS and Linux. May work in Windows 10 if [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq) is installed.

### Install prerequisites

Install **ripgrep** to get acceptable performance because searching 700 MB of
compressed data with zgrep is 15x slower. See
[https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep](https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep). (*If
anyone wants to rewrite this to use zgrep or another search engine, be my
guest.*)

While it's not required, **xsv** greatly improves table layout, especially for
non-English names, by using "elastic tabs". See
[https://crates.io/crates/xsv](https://crates.io/crates/xsv).

### Install IMDb_xref
Either **[download an IMDb_xref release](https://github.com/Monty/IMDb_xref/releases)** or type these commands into a terminal window:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Monty/IMDb_xref.git
cd IMDb_xref
```

## Usage

### Generate some data

Run **./generateXrefData.sh** to download the IMDb data files and generate lists
and spreadsheets containing cast members, characters portrayed, alternate
titles, and other details from IMDb. This takes 40 seconds on my 2014 iMac
(*Note: I have a fast internet connection.*)

Re-running **./generateXrefData.sh** doesn't download the IMDb data files again.
This reduces the run time to 20 seconds. It will overwrite any files
produced earlier that day but not those from any previous day.

Since **./generateXrefData.sh** displays statistics as it runs, you probably
noticed that it only produced data on 3 shows with 92 episodes -- crediting 90
people with 704 lines of credits.

If you run **./generateXrefData.sh -td**, you'll get 98 shows with 2159 episodes
-- crediting 3605 people with 17276 lines of credits. Running this takes about
45 seconds. However, queries should still take less than one second.

Data can grow quite large. If you use all the files in /Contrib, you'll generate
over 7.5 MB of data, including two 46,000 line Credits spreadsheets.

### Run some queries

Run **./xrefCast.sh -h** to see some example queries. Experiment making up other
queries. One may lead to another...

<details><summary><b>Show output</b></summary>

    $ ./xrefCast.sh -h
    Cross-reference shows, actors, and the characters they portray using data from IMDB.
    
    USAGE:
        ./xrefCast.sh [OPTIONS] [-f SEARCH_FILE] SEARCH_TERM [SEARCH_TERM ...]
    
    OPTIONS:
        -h      Print this message.
        -a      All -- Only print 'All names' section.
        -f      File -- Query a specific file rather than "Credits-Person*csv".
        -s      Summarize -- Only print 'Duplicated names' section.
        -i      Print info about any files that are searched.
    
    EXAMPLES:
        ./xrefCast.sh 'Olivia Colman'
        ./xrefCast.sh 'Queen Elizabeth II' 'Princess Diana'
        ./xrefCast.sh 'The Crown'
        ./xrefCast.sh -s 'The Night Manager' 'The Crown' 'The Durrells in Corfu'
</details>

Run **./demo.sh** to see the information returned from these queries and more.
Each query should take less than one second.

***Protip***: typing **alias xr="${PWD}/xrefCast.sh \\"\\$@\\""** while in this
directory will allow you to type **xr 'Princess Diana'** instead of
**./xrefCast.sh 'Princess Diana'** -- and, **xr** can be run from anywhere.

### Go further

You can select different shows by using one or more of the .tconst files in the
Contrib directory or creating your own .tconst file. You can even translate
non-English titles to their English equivalents by using a .xlate file.

The default for **./generateXrefData.sh** is to use all .tconst and all .xlate
files in the top level directory. So put whatever files you want there.  (*Your
contributions are welcome. Start your own lists: broad genres such as Comedies,
Sci-Fi, Musicals, Historical Dramas - or more specific lists like "TV shows with
Robots")

Until I find time to produce more documentation, you can learn a lot from the
descriptive comments in the shell scripts and *.example files.
